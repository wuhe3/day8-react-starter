### O
- Use Flyway to manage database migrations
- Draw concept map for Spring Boot with teams
- Practice the REACT basics, through counter component

### R
- I feel a bit challenged by implementing the sum of the counter component.
- I can see the improvement of team collaboration in the concept map session.


### I
- I don't have enough knowledge about React (e.g. useState and useEffect hooks), it is quite important to understand them to be able to use them properly.
- Maybe we're more familiar each other, we can work more efficiently.


### D: 
- Practice more with the counter component, and try to implement a new feature to it.
- Study more about React hooks.
